# Quick start

Run `npm install` followed by `npm run`

Tests can be run with the command `npm test`

## To do, given more time

* Implement end to end tests, currently only unit tests have been worked on
* Tidy up unit test code. There's a fair amount of redundancy in there
* Implement postcode validation on the front end
* General refactring and polishing of code base

## Project skelton based on `angular-seed` â€” the seed for AngularJS apps

This project was bottstrapped with angular-seed https://github.com/angular/angular-seed
